Hi! I'm Srshti (she / her) and I'm currently a Senior Data Scientist at the Capital One. I finished my PhD in Statistics through the STOR-i Centre for Doctoral Training (based at Lancaster University) at the end of 2023. 

I am also an active Fellow of the Royal Statistical Society (RSS). I have recently becomes a member of the RSS Council. In 2024, I served as Chair for the Young Statisticians Section of the RSS and I was selected to be a part of the inaugural cohort of the Future Leaders programme.
